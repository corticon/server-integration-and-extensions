Here is a step-by-step guide on how you would adapt and use the generic_rest_client.py file for any REST API.
Install the requests library: This is the standard for making HTTP requests in Python. If you don't have it, open your command prompt and run:
```Shell
pip install requests
```
## Configure the Server Details
Open generic_rest_client.py and go to the "Configuration Section". You must edit these variables to match the server you want to contact:
server_protocol: Change to 'https' if the server uses SSL/TLS.

server_address: Change from 'localhost' to the server's domain or IP address if it's not running on your local machine.

server_port: This is critical. It must match the port the server application is listening on (e.g., 8080, 8850, etc.).

server_path: This is the specific "endpoint" for the action you want to perform (e.g., /axis/corticon/execute, /api/v1/users, etc.). You'll find this in the API's documentation.

## Prepare the Payload File:
Create your JSON payload in a separate file (e.g., input.json).
Update the payload_filepath variable in the script to point to the location of your JSON file.
Add Authentication (If Needed):
Many APIs are protected and require an API key or token.
If yours does, you would add an Authorization key to the headers dictionary in the script. The API's documentation will tell you the exact format (e.g., 'Authorization': 'Bearer your_api_key_here').
Run the Script:
Open a command prompt or terminal in the same directory as your script.
Execute the script by running: python generic_rest_client.py.
The script will then print the server's response or an error message if something went wrong.
